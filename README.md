# Ronma.AI

## Abstract
> Nowadays, the machine learning and the massive data computing are very popluar. But are they the real AI ? I DO NOT think so. Mostly these are based on probability calculation. Is this like the human beings' brain ? Absolutely NOT. 

**Ronma tries to think like a real human and has no limitation on domains.**

## HOW
> Ronma has a lot of components. It's a distributed system. The mind is a thinker and the services is the periphery of the system.

## Concepts

### Mind
> The mind is the main controller. It always tries to think and find is there a better way to finish a job.

### Core
> The core helps the mind to think. It's the main components of the Ronma.

### Sensitive Level
> If the minds sense too much, we will need too much memory. And Ronma will learn too much even for a simple job. So we need a level to tell Ronma not to learn too deep.
- Limited sensitive level
- Active sensitive level
- Full sensitive level (Best never use this mode)
